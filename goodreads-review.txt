Learnability
============
- new users: how fast are new users learning the product?

Why should I rate books, I've never read? How to find books I have read?
Can I set up German language?

On the first view it's not very clear where to rate the book. Rating is the most
important thing I think to be able to use the website.

Too many things are challenging to acquire my interest: Reading Challenge,
Choice Awards, Want to Read, Blog, News feed.

Head line helps understand the purpose of the site: "Meet your favorite book,
find your reading community, and manage your reading life."

Menu and icons is similar to other social apps (bell symbol, chat symbol,
letter, friends)

Efficiency
==========
- how fast can recurring users perform particular tasks?

Memorability
============
- after some time can users easily remember how to use the product?

Errors
======
- goals: minimize errors / quick recovery from errors

Registration: after registration I nearly invited all my Google contacts to
goodreads. fortunately I could recover from the error pressing "skip this page".

Satisfaction
============
- is it pleasant or fun to use the product?

It is very hard to enter 20 books to receive recommendations.
I have entered a book. Goodreads shows in the UPDATES feed blog posts
from the author that are 4 years old.
